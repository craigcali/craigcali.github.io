### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because it is a nostalgic piece. This lab
    is the first lab I've ever done since attending this university 
    and I hold it dear to me. I learned how to write a function displaying
    text in a program, not to mention the classic "Hello World" that every
    coder knows about.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I liked the concept of creating
    a game. The Hi-Lo game was a great lab for utilizing nested if-else 
    statements. The interactiveness of inputting numbers to guess numbers
    that are above or below a designated number is another liked feature
    I recognized from this lab.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I grew up with the Mad Libs books
    as a kid. The concept of creating a program that collects string input
    from the user to create a sandwich is interesting. I can visualize 
    how more enhanced programs could be made for apps or websites that 
    handle food orders such as Uber Eats or DoorDash.
